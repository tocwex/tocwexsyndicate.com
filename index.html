            An ethos of builders, by builders, for builders
          </h2>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            Blockchains present a new landscape for economic activity, grounded
            not in centralized power but in decentralized, rules-based
            consensus. Instead of nation-state controlled economies, we have a
            burgeoning new opportunity for network-state economies, where
            voluntary participation and peer-to-peer interaction accelerate
            innovation and human flourishing.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            Yet something's missing. While blockchain-based financial assets
            give us mechanisms for funding commitments and settlement in the
            "world of bits", smart contracts and on-chain interactions are
            insufficient for building anything other than a financialized
            circular economy. A digital casino. A zero sum game.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            If these new network states want a profitable economic system, they
            need a way to produce exports. A way to interact and provide value
            to the world outside—the world in which humans operate. Currently,
            crypto's "export industry" looks like a hellscape of centralized
            exchanges that make it possible to trade tokens for fiat currency.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            Of course, the formation of centralized exchanges as an initial
            export pathway is understandable. They were the clearest mechanism
            for available technology—financial trading desks—to improve the user
            experience for getting market participants into the world of bits.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            But they create huge limitations on the realm of possible
            applications. Centralized exchanges are easily targeted and
            corrupted institutions—whether by deliberately hostile surveillance
            and control organizations or apathetic profit-motivated data
            brokers—but that is just the most apparent shortcoming.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            The much more pernicious shortcoming that arises from forcing the
            crypto world's exports through centralized exchanges is a
            <span class="underline">bandwidth limitation</span>. There is only
            so much money—information about the price of goods and
            services—which can flow through these institutions before they are
            captured, manipulated, and turned out. It is only the specific
            details of the captors that are unknown. A question of
            <span class="underline">when</span>, rather than a question of
            <span class="underline">if</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            And as our own centralized institutions fail in myriad ways, "trust"
            gets a bad rap in an industry that is built around 'trustless' and
            'decentralized' financial settlement. But trust is humanity's killer
            app. Trusted relationships across time and space have made humans
            the global apex predator.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            Trust fills the gaps as we discover the programmatic solutions, or
            in dynamically changing environments. It is why and how institutions
            form, and why they are captured and corrupted. To counter the
            detrimental nature of this capture, we place trust in new
            individuals who then form new institutions that inch ever closer to
            deserving our trust. And thus the cycle continues.
          </p>
          <p class="py-1 text-lg">
            Bitcoin disintermediated untrustworthy legacy currencies and banking
            systems when it made financial settlement of peer-to-peer global
            markets immediately accessible to anyone with a basic computer.
            Ethereum made this capability programmatic.

            But if network states are to push us forward to better methods of
            human organization, money isn't the only tool to consider. The
            mechanisms for communication, for building, and for network
            coordination must also be disintermediated.

            We aim to create tools for peer-to-peer economic relationships.
            Economic relationships unmediated not only by payment processors or
            central banks, but unmediated even by the tool makers. Why? Because
            <span class="underline">you</span> can't trust a peer if
            <span class="underline">they</span> can't trust their tools.

            In giving individuals the sovereign tools to have trusted
            peer-to-peer interactions we will enable their relationships to
            bridge between the world of atoms and the world of bits and,
            hopefully, build the foundations to form trustworthy institutions
            necessary to bridge between nation states and network states.
