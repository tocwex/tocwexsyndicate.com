## Running the dev server

The package.json file should be set up so that all you need to do is open a terminal prompt and run `npm run dev`. This will give you a `lite-server` that live reloads at `localhost:3000` and auto-rebuild your css files on saved changes. Enjoy.

TODO: get the vercel building to work automagically.
